  "readme": "# RELLAX\n\nRellax is a buttery smooth, super lightweight (1021bytes gzipped), vanilla javascript parallax library. **Update:** Rellax now works on mobile (v1.0.0). \n\n* [Demo Website](https://dixonandmoe.com/rellax/)\n\nHave any suggestions or feedback? Reach out [@dixonandmoe](https://twitter.com/dixonandmoe)\n\n## Getting Started\n`npm install rellax --save` or if you're old school like us download and insert `rellax.min.js`\n\n```html\n<div class=\"rellax\">\n  I‚Äôm that default chill speed of \"-2\"\n</div>\n<div class=\"rellax\" data-rellax-speed=\"7\">\n  I‚Äôm super fast!!\n</div>\n<div class=\"rellax\" data-rellax-speed=\"-4\">\n  I‚Äôm extra slow and smooth\n</div>\n\n<script src=\"rellax.min.js\"></script>\n<script>\n  // Accepts any class name\n  var rellax = new Rellax('.rellax');\n</script>\n```\n```html\n<script>\n  // Also can pass in optional settings block\n  var rellax = new Rellax('.rellax');\n</script>\n```\n## Features\n\n### Centering\nAfter some fantastic work from [@p-realinho](https://github.com/p-realinho), we just released the ability to center parallax elements in your viewport! We'll be building a nice demo website, but for now check out the tests folder for several examples of how it works.\n\nThere's two ways to implement centering, either on specific elements or as a global option.\n```html\n<div class=\"rellax\" data-rellax-percentage=\"0.5\">\n  I‚Äôm that default chill speed of \"-2\" and \"centered\"\n</div>\n<div class=\"rellax\" data-rellax-speed=\"7\" data-rellax-percentage=\"0.5\">\n  I‚Äôm super fast!! And super centered!!\n</div>\n<div class=\"rellax\" data-rellax-speed=\"-4\" data-rellax-percentage=\"0.5\">\n  I‚Äôm extra slow and smooth, and hella centered.\n</div>\n```\n```html\n<script>\n  // Center all the things!\n  var rellax = new Rellax('.rellax', {\n    center: true\n  });\n</script>\n```\n### Destroy\n```html\n<script>\n  // Start Rellax\n  var rellax = new Rellax('.rellax');\n  \n  // End Rellax and reset parallax elements to their original positions\n  rellax.destroy();\n</script>\n```\n## In the Wild\nIf you're using Rellax in production, we'd love to list you here! Let us know: moe@dixonandmoe.com\n- [Airgora](https://www.airgora.com/competition)\n- [Lorem Ipsum Generator](https://loremipsumgenerator.com/)\n- [Alex Bailon Portfolio](http://www.iambailon.com/)\n\n## Development\nIn the spirit of lightweight javascript, the build processes (thus far) is lightweight also.\n\n1. Open demo.html\n2. Make code changes and refresh browser\n3. Once feature is finished or bug fixed, use [jshint](http://jshint.com/) to lint code\n4. Fix lint issues then use [Google Closure Compiler](https://closure-compiler.appspot.com/home) to minify\n5. üçª\n\n",
